## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as many relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and description.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Screen captures and GIFs/Videos help a lot.

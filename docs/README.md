## 📚 Guides

  The definitive guide to the Fradual programming language — syntax, data types, operators, control flow, functions, closures, arrays, classes, and native functions.

- **[Architecture & Internals](architecture.md)**
  A deep dive into the compiler pipeline: lexer, parser, bytecode compiler, stack-based VM, upvalue system, the complete 35-opcode instruction set, and known limitations.

- **[Development Guide](development.md)**
  Everything you need to build, test, debug, and contribute — setup instructions, testing strategies, debugging tips, project structure, and security limits.
